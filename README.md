## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice
<br>
<br>
I started off this project with an idea for a local flower shop. I searched for a website template, then commented out/deleted sections that weren't necessary for my vision of the flow of the website. I wanted a simple interface where people could scroll and click sections that lead them to new web pages with specialized categories for the services the flower shop offers. A flower theme seems to fit best in this scenario so I picked a background image and based the text and sections around the colors in the image. I made three similar web pages and two simpler types for sections that wouldn't have as much info.  
## Optimizations
Since this is one of my first projects, there is a lot that can be worked on. The overall layout is well done but I would have liked to implement more javascript and back end capabilities to round out the website. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about patience with this project. Starting off with a template, learning what the previous engineer put and how each section worked was a task that I thoroughly enjoyed but at times despised. Also, knowing my skills are not to the highest of caliber at the moment due to this being my first website I've made, I had to respect my boundaries in what I understood and did not.
